## 👋 Hi, I'm Ahsen Jaffer

I’m a Senior Software Engineer and Tech Lead with 20+ years of experience shipping resilient, large-scale distributed systems at Amazon, VMware, and other enterprise environments — now channeling that expertise into the frontier of AI infrastructure. I specialize in cloud architecture, platform engineering, and performance-tuned Java backends.

## 🔧 What I'm Working On
- 🤖 Building tools to track, log, and evaluate LLM prompts (`prompt-tracker-lite`, OpenAI Slackbot)
- 📚 Writing a blog series on distributed system design, Kafka pipelines, and region failover strategies
- 🧠 Deep diving into AI Ops, CRDTs, system design patterns, and inference-serving architectures

## 🎯 Mission & Tech Philosophy

I believe engineering is a craft — a balance of precision, empathy, and long-term thinking. Whether designing fault-tolerant infrastructure or debugging obscure production failures, I strive to build systems that serve real people — reliably and safely.

I'm especially drawn to infrastructure that enables progress: platforms that empower teams, tools that make AI safer, and backend systems that don’t crumble under pressure. I value clear thinking, minimalism in design, and the courage to challenge assumptions.
